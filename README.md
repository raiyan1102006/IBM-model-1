# IBM-model-1
Machine Translation using IBM Model 1

**Author:** Raiyan Abdul Baten

This project was done as part of a homework in the CSC448 Statistical Speech and Language Processing course at the University of Rochester.

## Task
Implement IBM Model 1, and plot log probability of training and test files.


## Usage Instruction

For the full data, only the log-likelihoods will be printed on the console. 
For the sample data, the exact output instructed in the m1.out file will be printed. 

- To run the program on the sample data, use the following command:
```
python3 ibm1.py sample
```

- To run the program on the full data, use:
```
python3 ibm1.py 
```

## Results on the full data
Please note that in the output_LL.jpg figure, iteration 0 is not plotted to make things visually pleasing.
